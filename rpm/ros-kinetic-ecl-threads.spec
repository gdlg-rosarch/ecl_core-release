This package provides the c++ extensions for a variety of threaded programming
tools. These are usually different on different platforms, so the architecture
for a cross-platform framework is also implemented.

# in the install tree that was dropped by catkin, and source it.  It will
# set things like CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH, PKG_CONFIG_PATH, and PYTHONPATH.
