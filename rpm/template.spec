%description
Some fast/convenient type converters, mostly for char strings or strings. These
are not really fully fleshed out, alot of them could use the addition for the
whole range of fundamental types (e.g. all integers, not just int, unsigned
int). They will come as the need arises.

# In case we're installing to a non-standard location, look for a setup.sh
# in the install tree that was dropped by catkin, and source it.  It will
# set things like CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH, PKG_CONFIG_PATH, and PYTHONPATH.
