%description
Interprocess mechanisms vary greatly across platforms - sysv, posix, win32,
there are more than a few. This package provides an infrastructure to allow for
developing cross platform c++ wrappers around the lower level c api's that
handle these mechanisms. These make it not only easier to utilise such
mechanisms, but allow it to be done consistently across platforms.

# in the install tree that was dropped by catkin, and source it.  It will
# set things like CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH, PKG_CONFIG_PATH, and PYTHONPATH.
